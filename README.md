# KoboldAI
Stupid AI excercise project for turn-based games

Works with Unity 5

Idea of this project is to use Unity specific code as little as possible and keep visuals completely separated from actual logic. That's why this project does not use Unity3D's built-in collision detection and raycasting.

Features:
- Pathfinding using Dijkstra's algorithm
- Turn-based movement
- Different movement speeds for different types of travel (walk, swim, fly)
- Raycasting in 2D graph
- Sight and Hearing for actor detection
